### 👨🏽‍💻 About Me
I’m an undergraduate student studying **Statistics** with a growing passion for **web development and data-driven applications**.

I’m now focused on modern JavaScript technologies — learning and building projects with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  

I love turning ideas into responsive, functional apps and improving through challenges from **Frontend Mentor** and **Udemy tutorials**.
