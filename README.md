# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hello! I'm Riliwan, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a diverse skill set and a love for crafting innovative web applications. With expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, I thrive in creating seamless user experiences and robust functionality.

On the front-end, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using modern frameworks like React and Angular to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I have a keen eye for design and enjoy translating wireframes and mockups into pixel-perfect layouts.

On the back-end, I have experience working with various programming languages such as Python, PHP, or JavaScript (Node.js). I am proficient in using frameworks like Django, Laravel , or Express.js to develop scalable and efficient server-side applications. I have worked with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL to ensure seamless data management.

I am adept at API integration, enabling smooth communication between different parts of an application or connecting with third-party services. I am comfortable working with version control systems like Git and deploying applications to cloud platforms such as AWS or Heroku.

As a Full Stack Developer, I thrive on problem-solving and finding elegant solutions to complex challenges. I am a quick learner and always eager to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry best practices. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, where I can contribute my expertise and work collectively towards creating exceptional web experiences.
